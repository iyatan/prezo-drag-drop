# prezo-assignment

Hi there, thanks for your interest in Prezo. We are excited to work with builders and hackers to help us shape Prezo.

This repo hosts a basic drag and drop interface that we built into Prezo. The version in this repo is incomplete, buggy and just not ready. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a working version of the drag and drop interface for slides.

This is what it will look like when ready [Demo video](https://www.loom.com/share/be346974201f450f9dc7e62480ce83e6)

## Requirements

- get the drag and drop working

- be able to scroll inside the slide container while dragging slides

- fix minor css issues that you can notice

## Advanced requirements

- make sure the dropped slide is always visible in the viewport

- allow dragging multiple slides at once

- add undo/redo

- any ux flair you want to add OR an implementation that you think is even better than using the HTML Drag and Drop API

The project uses Vue 3 and Vite. You don't really need to know a lot about Vue to complete this. The official Vue docs are quite good if you want to quickly understand how to work with Vue.

Please do not use any dragging related libaries.
